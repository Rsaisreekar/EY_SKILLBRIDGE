**Generative AI & Multi-Agent System for Bridging Skill Gaps
Problem Context**
Students often struggle to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and the skills required in today’s rapidly evolving job market. Traditional learning methods lack personalization and fail to adapt to industry trends, leaving students unprepared for employability challenges.

**Proposed Solution**
This project introduces a web app that leverages Generative AI and multi-agent systems to bridge skill gaps, improve employability, and empower students to achieve their career goals. The platform offers personalized guidance, actionable insights, and dynamic content tailored to individual learning needs.

**Key Features**
**Personalized Skill Assessment**
The web app conducts AI-driven evaluations to identify a student’s current skill level, strengths, and areas for improvement.

**Multi-Agent Dynamic Learning Paths**
Generative AI, guided by the multi-agent system, curates personalized learning paths and resources, ensuring each student gets a tailored educational experience that adapts to their goals and pace.

**Progress Tracking and Feedback
**The web app includes a progress tracker that allows students to monitor their learning journey with clear milestones, performance analytics, and real-time feedback to improve specific skill areas.

**Industry Alignment
**By integrating APIs for real-time market analysis, the platform ensures that learning materials remain relevant to the latest industry demands, preparing students with in-demand skills.

**Installation**

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
